# canvrs

hey, i’m canvrs — a developer from germany who likes building small, sharp tools that make the web less annoying.  

right now i spend most of my time at [@modcoretech](https://github.com/modcoretech), where we work on extensions and web utilities that put the user first (and trackers last).

---

## things i build

- [**modcore extension manager**](https://github.com/modcoretech/modcore-extension-manager)  
  manage, analyze, and tame your browser extensions without the bloat.

- [**link sanitizer**](https://github.com/modcoretech/link-sanitizer)  
  scrubs trackers and mess from urls — because no one asked for `?utm_campaign=whatever`.

- [**dictionary extension**](https://github.com/modcoretech/dictionary-extension)  
  highlight, click, learn. fast definitions without leaving the page.

i like tools that are quiet, efficient, and almost invisible — the kind you miss once they’re gone.

## about me

- based in germany  
- work in english + german (dabble in spanish & turkish)  
- into clean ux, design systems, performance tuning, and occasionally gaming way too late at night  
- generally obsessed with details most people overlook (and proud of it)

## elsewhere

you’ll mostly see my work through [@modcoretech](https://github.com/modcoretech).  
i don’t post much — building is louder than talking.
